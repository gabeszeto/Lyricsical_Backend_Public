# Lyricsical

My first completed project!! 🥳  

Lyricsical is a daily starting lyrics game. It tests your rhythm keeping and if you know when the lyrics *actually* start in a song. There is a second part of the game where you choose which lyric (out of three choices) you think appears first in the song.
